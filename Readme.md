The wrappers presented here are for examples and they are constantly changed or improved to follow the
version specification.

Versions are kept when a major change is done compromising the old interface.

## Python

The wrapper requires only **requests** package, installable via:

```
pip install requests
```

## Go

Only the language is enough for running the wrapper, which is still under development.
